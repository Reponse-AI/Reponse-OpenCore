## Common payload envelope

All webhook handlers parse the raw body as JSON. The payload structure is provider-specific, but Reponse normalises each event into internal database records.

```
POST /api/shopify/webhooks/{workspaceId}
Content-Type: application/json
X-Shopify-Topic: products/update
X-Shopify-Hmac-Sha256: <base64-signature>
X-Shopify-Webhook-Id: <unique-id>
X-Shopify-Shop-Domain: my-store.myshopify.com

{ ...provider-specific JSON payload... }
```

## Delivery and retries

Webhooks are delivered as HTTP `POST` requests with a JSON body. Respond with `2xx` to acknowledge receipt. Failed deliveries are retried with exponential backoff by the provider.

| Requirement | Value |
|---|---|
| Method | `POST` |
| Content-Type | `application/json` |
| Expected response | `2xx` within 5 seconds |
| Retry on failure | Yes (provider-specific backoff) |

Make your handler **idempotent** — providers may deliver the same event more than once. See [Webhooks Overview](doc:webhooks-overview) for details on idempotency patterns.
